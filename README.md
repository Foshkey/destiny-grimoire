Before you begin, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

Global package is recommended: [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)

Install recommended packages:

```bash
npm install -g angular-cli
```

And install all node dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Finally, run the default cli serve:

```bash
ng serve
```

Angular CLI should do the rest for you.
